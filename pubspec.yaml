# The following line prevents the package from being accidentally published to
# pub.dev using `flutter pub publish`. This is preferred for private packages.
publish_to: "none" # Remove this line if you wish to publish to pub.dev

# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number is used as CFBundleVersion.
# Read more about iOS versioning at
# https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CoreFoundationKeys.html
# In Windows, build-name is used as the major, minor, and patch parts
# of the product and file versions while build-number is used as the build suffix.

   # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
   # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

   # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
   # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

   # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
   # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
   # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
   # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
   # example:
   # fonts:
   #   - family: Schyler
   #     fonts:
   #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
   #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
   #         style: italic
   #   - family: Trajan Pro
   #     fonts:
   #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
   #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
   #         weight: 700
